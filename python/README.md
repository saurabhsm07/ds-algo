solving 1 problem a day on data-structure and algorithims, to maintain and improve core programming concepts.
Problems solved will be mostly from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ 
solution might be for a general input statement and might not work for all input cases
links for indivisual problems add solution will be added in the indivisual problem statements
