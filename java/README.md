# DataStructure-And-Algorithim-Study
repository created to learn, practice and improve skills in implementing datastructures and algorithims to complex programming problem. 
most of the content (problem statements,solutions and some theory and algorithim discribtion) picked up from 'geeksForGeeks'. 

most solutions are done for a general case , to understand the algorithim implementation , different i/p cases not considered ...yet
